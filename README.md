# Fractal


### How to build
```
Just execute the index.html file
```
Trying to generate Fractals using html , css & js 

But it's very slow on high res & large iterations.
Maybe use GPU.js? ðŸ¤” 

Features I want to add :
- Zooming
- Generate Julia sets. (Now only Mandelbrot sets can be generated)
- Save as png (least priority)
