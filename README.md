# Fractal


### How to build
```
Just execute the index.html file
```

Or just simply visit this [link!](https://n0t-human.github.io/Fractal/)

Trying to generate Fractals using html , css & js 

But it's very slow on high res & large iterations.
Maybe use GPU.js? ðŸ¤” 

Features implemented : 
- Generate Julia sets. (Now only Mandelbrot sets can be generated)

Features I want to add :
- Zooming
- Save as png (least priority)

###### NEVER SETTLE
